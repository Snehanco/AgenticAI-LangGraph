The agent will use Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its language model, a basic weather function as a tool, and a simple prompt to guide its behavior.\\nFor this example, you will need to set up a Claude (Anthropic) account and get an API key. Then, set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\ndef get_weather(city: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Get weather for a given city.\"\"\"\\n    return f\"It\\'s always sunny in {city}!\"\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\\n    tools=[get_weather],\\n    system_prompt=\"You are a helpful assistant\",\\n)\\n\\n# Run the agent\\nagent.invoke(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"what is the weather in sf\"}]}\\n)\\n\\nTo learn how to trace your agent with LangSmith, see the LangSmith documentation.\\n\\u200bBuild a real-world agent\\nNext, build a practical weather forecasting agent that demonstrates key production concepts:\\n\\nDetailed system prompts for better agent behavior\\nCreate tools that integrate with external data\\nModel configuration for consistent responses\\nStructured output for predictable results\\nConversational memory for chat-like interactions\\nCreate and run the agent create a fully functional agent\\n\\nLet’s walk through each step:\\n1Define the system promptThe system prompt defines your agent’s role and behavior. Keep it specific and actionable:CopyAsk AISYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.\\n\\nYou have access to two tools:\\n\\n- get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location\\n- get_user_location: use this to get the user\\'s location\\n\\nIf a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location.

This is the foundation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): enhancing an LLM’s answers with context-specific information.\\n\\u200bBuilding a knowledge base\\nA knowledge base is a repository of documents or structured data used during retrieval.\\nIf you need a custom knowledge base, you can use LangChain’s document loaders and vector stores to build one from your own data.\\nIf you already have a knowledge base (e.g., a SQL database, CRM, or internal documentation system), you do not need to rebuild it. You can:\\nConnect it as a tool for an agent in Agentic RAG.\\nQuery it and supply the retrieved content as context to the LLM (2-Step RAG).\\n\\nSee the following tutorial to build a searchable knowledge base and minimal RAG workflow:\\nTutorial: Semantic searchLearn how to create a searchable knowledge base from your own data using LangChain’s document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores.\\nIn this tutorial, you’ll build a search engine over a PDF, enabling retrieval of passages relevant to a query. You’ll also implement a minimal RAG workflow on top of this engine to see how external knowledge can be integrated into LLM reasoning.Learn more\\n\\u200bFrom retrieval to RAG\\nRetrieval allows LLMs to access relevant context at runtime. But most real-world applications go one step further: they integrate retrieval with generation to produce grounded, context-aware answers.\\nThis is the core idea behind Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The retrieval pipeline becomes a foundation for a broader system that combines search with generation.\\n\\u200bRetrieval Pipeline\\nA typical retrieval workflow looks like this:\\n\\nEach component is modular: you can swap loaders, splitters, embeddings, or vector stores without rewriting the app’s logic.\\n\\u200bBuilding Blocks\\nDocument loadersIngest data from external sources (Google Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.), returning standardized Document objects.Learn moreText splittersBreak large docs into smaller chunks that will be retrievable individually and fit within a model’s context window.Learn moreEmbedding modelsAn embedding model turns text into a vector of numbers so that texts with similar meaning land close together in that vector space.Learn moreVector storesSpecialized databases for storing and searching embeddings.Learn moreRetrieversA retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query.Learn more\\n\\u200bRAG Architectures\\nRAG can be implemented in multiple ways, depending on your system’s needs. We outline each type in the sections below.\\n\\nArchitectureDescriptionControlFlexibilityLatencyExample Use Case\\n2-Step RAGRetrieval always happens before generation. Simple and predictable✅ High❌ Low⚡ FastFAQs, documentation botsAgentic RAGAn LLM-powered agent decides when and how to retrieve during reasoning❌ Low✅ High⏳ VariableResearch assistants with access to multiple toolsHybridCombines characteristics of both approaches with validation steps⚖️ Medium⚖️ Medium⏳ VariableDomain-specific Q&A with quality validation\\n\\nLatency: Latency is generally more predictable in 2-Step RAG, as the maximum number of LLM calls is known and capped. This predictability assumes that LLM inference time is the dominant factor. However, real-world latency may also be affected by the performance of retrieval steps—such as API response times, network delays, or database queries—which can vary based on the tools and infrastructure in use.\\n\\u200b2-step RAG\\nIn 2-Step RAG, the retrieval step is always executed before the generation step. This architecture is straightforward and predictable, making it suitable for many applications where the retrieval of relevant documents is a clear prerequisite for generating an answer.\\n\\nTutorial: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)See how to build a Q&A chatbot that can answer questions grounded in your data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\\nThis tutorial walks through two approaches:\\nA RAG agent that runs searches with a flexible tool—great for general-purpose use.\\nA 2-step RAG chain that requires just one LLM call per query—fast and efficient for simpler tasks.\\nLearn more\\n\\u200bAgentic RAG\\nAgentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the strengths of Retrieval-Augmented Generation with agent-based reasoning. Instead of retrieving documents before answering, an agent (powered by an LLM) reasons step-by-step and decides when and how to retrieve information during the interaction.\\nThe only thing an agent needs to enable RAG behavior is access to one or more tools that can fetch external knowledge — such as documentation loaders, web APIs, or database queries.\\n\\nCopyAsk AIimport requests\\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\n\\n@tool\\ndef fetch_url(url: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Fetch text content from a URL\"\"\"\\n    response = requests.get(url, timeout=10.0)\\n    response.raise_for_status()\\n    return response.text\\n\\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\\\\\\nUse fetch_url when you need to fetch information from a web-page; quote relevant snippets.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\\n    tools=[fetch_url], # A tool for retrieval\\n    system_prompt=system_prompt,\\n)\\n\\nShow Extended example: Agentic RAG for LangGraph\\'s llms.txtThis example implements an Agentic RAG system to assist users in querying LangGraph documentation.

It walks through state, as well as composing common graph structures such as sequences, branches, and loops. It also covers LangGraph’s control features, including the Send API for map-reduce workflows and the Command API for combining state updates with “hops” across nodes.\\n\\u200bSetup\\nInstall langgraph:\\npipuvCopyAsk AIpip install -U langgraph\\n\\nSet up LangSmith for better debuggingSign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs.\\n\\u200bDefine and update state\\nHere we show how to define and update state in LangGraph. We will demonstrate:\\n\\nHow to use state to define a graph’s schema\\nHow to use reducers to control how state updates are processed.\\n\\n\\u200bDefine state\\nState in LangGraph can be a TypedDict, Pydantic model, or dataclass. Below we will use TypedDict. See this section for detail on using Pydantic.\\nBy default, graphs will have the same input and output schema, and the state determines that schema. See this section for how to define distinct input and output schemas.\\nLet’s consider a simple example using messages. This represents a versatile formulation of state for many LLM applications. See our concepts page for more detail.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain.messages import AnyMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: list[AnyMessage]\\n    extra_field: int\\n\\nThis state tracks a list of message objects, as well as an extra integer field.\\n\\u200bUpdate state\\nLet’s build an example graph with a single node. Our node is just a Python function that reads our graph’s state and makes updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain.messages import AIMessage\\n\\ndef node(state: State):\\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\\n    new_message = AIMessage(\"Hello!\")\\n    return {\"messages\": messages + [new_message], \"extra_field\": 10}\\n\\nThis node simply appends a message to our message list, and populates an extra field.\\nNodes should return updates to the state directly, instead of mutating the state.\\nLet’s next define a simple graph containing this node. We use StateGraph to define a graph that operates on this state. We then use add_node populate our graph.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_node(node)\\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"node\")\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nLangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let’s inspect our graph. See this section for detail on visualization.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\n\\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\n\\nIn this case, our graph just executes a single node. Let’s proceed with a simple invocation:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain.messages import HumanMessage\\n\\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(\"Hi\")]})\\nresult\\n\\nCopyAsk AI{\\'messages\\': [HumanMessage(content=\\'Hi\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'Hello!\\')], \\'extra_field\\': 10}\\n\\nNote that:\\n\\nWe kicked off invocation by updating a single key of the state.\\nWe receive the entire state in the invocation result.\\n\\nFor convenience, we frequently inspect the content of message objects via pretty-print:\\nCopyAsk AIfor message in result[\"messages\"]:\\n    message.pretty_print()\\n\\nCopyAsk AI================================ Human Message ================================\\n\\nHi\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n\\u200bProcess state updates with reducers\\nEach key in the state can have its own independent reducer function, which controls how updates from nodes are applied. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to the key should override it.\\nFor TypedDict state schemas, we can define reducers by annotating the corresponding field of the state with a reducer function.\\nIn the earlier example, our node updated the \"messages\" key in the state by appending a message to it. Below, we add a reducer to this key, such that updates are automatically appended:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\\n\\ndef add(left, right):\\n    \"\"\"Can also import `add` from the `operator` built-in.\"\"\"\\n    return left + right\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add]  \\n    extra_field: int\\n\\nNow our node can be simplified:\\nCopyAsk AIdef node(state: State):\\n    new_message = AIMessage(\"Hello!\")\\n    return {\"messages\": [new_message], \"extra_field\": 10}  \\n\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import START\\n\\ngraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).add_edge(START, \"node\").compile()\\n\\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(\"Hi\")]})\\n\\nfor message in result[\"messages\"]:\\n    message.pretty_print()\\n\\nCopyAsk AI================================ Human Message ================================\\n\\nHi\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nHello!\\n\\n\\u200bMessagesState\\nIn practice, there are additional considerations for updating lists of messages:\\n\\nWe may wish to update an existing message in the state.\\nWe may want to accept short-hands for message formats, such as OpenAI format.\\n\\nLangGraph includes a built-in reducer add_messages that handles these considerations:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]  \\n    extra_field: int\\n\\ndef node(state: State):\\n    new_message = AIMessage(\"Hello!\")\\n    return {\"messages\": [new_message], \"extra_field\": 10}\\n\\ngraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).set_entry_point(\"node\").compile()\\n\\nCopyAsk AIinput_message = {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hi\"}  \\n\\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [input_message]})\\n\\nfor message in result[\"messages\"]:\\n    message.pretty_print()\\n\\nCopyAsk AI================================ Human Message ================================\\n\\nHi\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nHello!\\n\\nThis is a versatile representation of state for applications involving chat models. LangGraph includes a pre-built MessagesState for convenience, so that we can have:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\\n\\nclass State(MessagesState):\\n    extra_field: int\\n\\n\\u200bBypass reducers with Overwrite\\nIn some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the Overwrite type for this purpose. When a node returns a value wrapped with Overwrite, the reducer is bypassed and the channel is set directly to that value.\\nThis is useful when you want to reset or replace accumulated state rather than merge it with existing values.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom langgraph.types import Overwrite\\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict\\nimport operator\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]\\n\\ndef add_message(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [\"first message\"]}\\n\\ndef replace_messages(state: State):\\n    # Bypass the reducer and replace the entire messages list\\n    return {\"messages\": Overwrite([\"replacement message\"])}\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"add_message\", add_message)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"replace_messages\", replace_messages)\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"add_message\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"add_message\", \"replace_messages\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"replace_messages\", END)\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [\"initial\"]})\\nprint(result[\"messages\"])\\n\\nCopyAsk AI[\\'replacement message\\']\\n\\nYou can also use JSON format with the special key \"__overwrite__\":\\nCopyAsk AIdef replace_messages(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": {\"__overwrite__\": [\"replacement message\"]}}\\n\\nWhen nodes execute in parallel, only one node can use Overwrite on the same state key in a given super-step. If multiple nodes attempt to overwrite the same key in the same super-step, an InvalidUpdateError will be raised.\\n\\u200bDefine input and output schemas\\nBy default, StateGraph operates with a single schema, and all nodes are expected to communicate using that schema. However, it’s also possible to define distinct input and output schemas for a graph.\\nWhen distinct schemas are specified, an internal schema will still be used for communication between nodes. The input schema ensures that the provided input matches the expected structure, while the output schema filters the internal data to return only the relevant information according to the defined output schema.\\nBelow, we’ll see how to define distinct input and output schema.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\n# Define the schema for the input\\nclass InputState(TypedDict):\\n    question: str\\n\\n# Define the schema for the output\\nclass OutputState(TypedDict):\\n    answer: str\\n\\n# Define the overall schema, combining both input and output\\nclass OverallState(InputState, OutputState):\\n    pass\\n\\n# Define the node that processes the input and generates an answer\\ndef answer_node(state: InputState):\\n    # Example answer and an extra key\\n    return {\"answer\": \"bye\", \"question\": state[\"question\"]}\\n\\n# Build the graph with input and output schemas specified\\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState, input_schema=InputState, output_schema=OutputState)\\nbuilder.add_node(answer_node)  # Add the answer node\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"answer_node\")  # Define the starting edge\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"answer_node\", END)  # Define the ending edge\\ngraph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph\\n\\n# Invoke the graph with an input and print the result\\nprint(graph.invoke({\"question\": \"hi\"}))\\n\\nCopyAsk AI{\\'answer\\': \\'bye\\'}\\n\\nNotice that the output of invoke only includes the output schema.\\n\\u200bPass private state between nodes\\nIn some cases, you may want nodes to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate logic but doesn’t need to be part of the main schema of the graph. This private data is not relevant to the overall input/output of the graph and should only be shared between certain nodes.\\nBelow, we’ll create an example sequential graph consisting of three nodes (node_1, node_2 and node_3), where private data is passed between the first two steps (node_1 and node_2), while the third step (node_3) only has access to the public overall state.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\n# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)\\nclass OverallState(TypedDict):\\n    a: str\\n\\n# Output from node_1 contains private data that is not part of the overall state\\nclass Node1Output(TypedDict):\\n    private_data: str\\n\\n# The private data is only shared between node_1 and node_2\\ndef node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:\\n    output = {\"private_data\": \"set by node_1\"}\\n    print(f\"Entered node `node_1`:\\\\n\\\\tInput: {state}.\\\\n\\\\tReturned: {output}\")\\n    return output\\n\\n# Node 2 input only requests the private data available after node_1\\nclass Node2Input(TypedDict):\\n    private_data: str\\n\\ndef node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:\\n    output = {\"a\": \"set by node_2\"}\\n    print(f\"Entered node `node_2`:\\\\n\\\\tInput: {state}.\\\\n\\\\tReturned: {output}\")\\n    return output\\n\\n# Node 3 only has access to the overall state (no access to private data from node_1)\\ndef node_3(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:\\n    output = {\"a\": \"set by node_3\"}\\n    print(f\"Entered node `node_3`:\\\\n\\\\tInput: {state}.\\\\n\\\\tReturned: {output}\")\\n    return output\\n\\n# Connect nodes in a sequence\\n# node_2 accepts private data from node_1, whereas\\n# node_3 does not see the private data.\\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState).add_sequence([node_1, node_2, node_3])\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\n# Invoke the graph with the initial state\\nresponse = graph.invoke(\\n    {\\n        \"a\": \"set at start\",\\n    }\\n)\\n\\nprint()\\nprint(f\"Output of graph invocation: {response}\")\\n\\nCopyAsk AIEntered node `node_1`:\\n    Input: {\\'a\\': \\'set at start\\'}.\\n    Returned: {\\'private_data\\': \\'set by node_1\\'}\\nEntered node `node_2`:\\n    Input: {\\'private_data\\': \\'set by node_1\\'}.\\n    Returned: {\\'a\\': \\'set by node_2\\'}\\nEntered node `node_3`:\\n    Input: {\\'a\\': \\'set by node_2\\'}.\\n    Returned: {\\'a\\': \\'set by node_3\\'}\\n\\nOutput of graph invocation: {\\'a\\': \\'set by node_3\\'}\\n\\n\\u200bUse Pydantic models for graph state\\nA StateGraph accepts a state_schema argument on initialization that specifies the “shape” of the state that the nodes in the graph can access and update.\\nIn our examples, we typically use a python-native TypedDict or dataclass for state_schema, but state_schema can be any type.\\nHere, we’ll see how a Pydantic BaseModel can be used for state_schema to add run-time validation on inputs.\\nKnown Limitations\\nCurrently, the output of the graph will NOT be an instance of a pydantic model.\\nRun-time validation only occurs on inputs to the first node in the graph, not on subsequent nodes or outputs.\\nThe validation error trace from pydantic does not show which node the error arises in.\\nPydantic’s recursive validation can be slow. For performance-sensitive applications, you may want to consider using a dataclass instead.\\n\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\n\\n# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)\\nclass OverallState(BaseModel):\\n    a: str\\n\\ndef node(state: OverallState):\\n    return {\"a\": \"goodbye\"}\\n\\n# Build the state graph\\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState)\\nbuilder.add_node(node)  # node_1 is the first node\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node\")  # Start the graph with node_1\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node\", END)  # End the graph after node_1\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\n# Test the graph with a valid input\\ngraph.invoke({\"a\": \"hello\"})\\n\\nInvoke the graph with an invalid input\\nCopyAsk AItry:\\n    graph.invoke({\"a\": 123})  # Should be a string\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    print(\"An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.\")\\n    print(e)\\n\\nCopyAsk AIAn exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.\\n1 validation error for OverallState\\na\\n  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]\\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.9/v/string_type\\n\\nSee below for additional features of Pydantic model state:\\nSerialization BehaviorWhen using Pydantic models as state schemas, it’s important to understand how serialization works, especially when:\\nPassing Pydantic objects as inputs\\nReceiving outputs from the graph\\nWorking with nested Pydantic models\\nLet’s see these behaviors in action.CopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\n\\nclass NestedModel(BaseModel):\\n    value: str\\n\\nclass ComplexState(BaseModel):\\n    text: str\\n    count: int\\n    nested: NestedModel\\n\\ndef process_node(state: ComplexState):\\n    # Node receives a validated Pydantic object\\n    print(f\"Input state type: {type(state)}\")\\n    print(f\"Nested type: {type(state.nested)}\")\\n    # Return a dictionary update\\n    return {\"text\": state.text + \" processed\", \"count\": state.count + 1}\\n\\n# Build the graph\\nbuilder = StateGraph(ComplexState)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"process\", process_node)\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"process\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"process\", END)\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\n# Create a Pydantic instance for input\\ninput_state = ComplexState(text=\"hello\", count=0, nested=NestedModel(value=\"test\"))\\nprint(f\"Input object type: {type(input_state)}\")\\n\\n# Invoke graph with a Pydantic instance\\nresult = graph.invoke(input_state)\\nprint(f\"Output type: {type(result)}\")\\nprint(f\"Output content: {result}\")\\n\\n# Convert back to Pydantic model if needed\\noutput_model = ComplexState(**result)\\nprint(f\"Converted back to Pydantic: {type(output_model)}\")\\n\\nRuntime Type CoercionPydantic performs runtime type coercion for certain data types.

Come posso aiutarti oggi?\\n\\n\\u200bAdd retry policies\\nThere are many use cases where you may wish for your node to have a custom retry policy, for example if you are calling an API, querying a database, or calling an LLM, etc. LangGraph lets you add retry policies to nodes.\\nTo configure a retry policy, pass the retry_policy parameter to the add_node. The retry_policy parameter takes in a RetryPolicy named tuple object. Below we instantiate a RetryPolicy object with the default parameters and associate it with a node:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.types import RetryPolicy\\n\\nbuilder.add_node(\\n    \"node_name\",\\n    node_function,\\n    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(),\\n)\\n\\nBy default, the retry_on parameter uses the default_retry_on function, which retries on any exception except for the following:\\n\\nValueError\\nTypeError\\nArithmeticError\\nImportError\\nLookupError\\nNameError\\nSyntaxError\\nRuntimeError\\nReferenceError\\nStopIteration\\nStopAsyncIteration\\nOSError\\n\\nIn addition, for exceptions from popular http request libraries such as requests and httpx it only retries on 5xx status codes.\\nExtended example: customizing retry policiesConsider an example in which we are reading from a SQL database. Below we pass two different retry policies to nodes:CopyAsk AIimport sqlite3\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, MessagesState, StateGraph, START\\nfrom langgraph.types import RetryPolicy\\nfrom langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase\\nfrom langchain.messages import AIMessage\\n\\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///:memory:\")\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\")\\n\\ndef query_database(state: MessagesState):\\n    query_result = db.run(\"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;\")\\n    return {\"messages\": [AIMessage(content=query_result)]}\\n\\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState):\\n    response = model.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\\n\\n# Define a new graph\\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\\nbuilder.add_node(\\n    \"query_database\",\\n    query_database,\\n    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(retry_on=sqlite3.OperationalError),\\n)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"model\", call_model, retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=5))\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"model\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"model\", \"query_database\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"query_database\", END)\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\n\\u200bAdd node caching\\nNode caching is useful in cases where you want to avoid repeating operations, like when doing something expensive (either in terms of time or cost). LangGraph lets you add individualized caching policies to nodes in a graph.\\nTo configure a cache policy, pass the cache_policy parameter to the add_node function. In the following example, a CachePolicy object is instantiated with a time to live of 120 seconds and the default key_func generator. Then it is associated with a node:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.types import CachePolicy\\n\\nbuilder.add_node(\\n    \"node_name\",\\n    node_function,\\n    cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=120),\\n)\\n\\nThen, to enable node-level caching for a graph, set the cache argument when compiling the graph. The example below uses InMemoryCache to set up a graph with in-memory cache, but SqliteCache is also available.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())\\n\\n\\u200bCreate a sequence of steps\\nPrerequisites\\nThis guide assumes familiarity with the above section on state.\\nHere we demonstrate how to construct a simple sequence of steps. We will show:\\n\\nHow to build a sequential graph\\nBuilt-in short-hand for constructing similar graphs.\\n\\nTo add a sequence of nodes, we use the add_node and add_edge methods of our graph:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n# Add nodes\\nbuilder.add_node(step_1)\\nbuilder.add_node(step_2)\\nbuilder.add_node(step_3)\\n\\n# Add edges\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_1\", \"step_2\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_2\", \"step_3\")\\n\\nWe can also use the built-in shorthand .add_sequence:\\nCopyAsk AIbuilder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\\n\\nWhy split application steps into a sequence with LangGraph?LangGraph makes it easy to add an underlying persistence layer to your application.\\nThis allows state to be checkpointed in between the execution of nodes, so your LangGraph nodes govern:\\nHow state updates are checkpointed\\nHow interruptions are resumed in human-in-the-loop workflows\\nHow we can “rewind” and branch-off executions using LangGraph’s time travel features\\nThey also determine how execution steps are streamed, and how your application is visualized and debugged using Studio.Let’s demonstrate an end-to-end example. We will create a sequence of three steps:\\nPopulate a value in a key of the state\\nUpdate the same value\\nPopulate a different value\\nLet’s first define our state. This governs the schema of the graph, and can also specify how to apply updates. See this section for more detail.In our case, we will just keep track of two values:CopyAsk AIfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    value_1: str\\n    value_2: int\\nOur nodes are just Python functions that read our graph’s state and make updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:CopyAsk AIdef step_1(state: State):\\n    return {\"value_1\": \"a\"}\\n\\ndef step_2(state: State):\\n    current_value_1 = state[\"value_1\"]\\n    return {\"value_1\": f\"{current_value_1} b\"}\\n\\ndef step_3(state: State):\\n    return {\"value_2\": 10}\\nNote that when issuing updates to the state, each node can just specify the value of the key it wishes to update.By default, this will overwrite the value of the corresponding key. You can also use reducers to control how updates are processed— for example, you can append successive updates to a key instead. See this section for more detail.Finally, we define the graph. We use StateGraph to define a graph that operates on this state.We will then use add_node and add_edge to populate our graph and define its control flow.CopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n# Add nodes\\nbuilder.add_node(step_1)\\nbuilder.add_node(step_2)\\nbuilder.add_node(step_3)\\n\\n# Add edges\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_1\", \"step_2\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_2\", \"step_3\")\\nSpecifying custom names\\nYou can specify custom names for nodes using add_node:CopyAsk AIbuilder.add_node(\"my_node\", step_1)\\nNote that:\\nadd_edge takes the names of nodes, which for functions defaults to node.__name__.\\nWe must specify the entry point of the graph. For this we add an edge with the START node.\\nThe graph halts when there are no more nodes to execute.\\nWe next compile our graph. This provides a few basic checks on the structure of the graph (e.g., identifying orphaned nodes). If we were adding persistence to our application via a checkpointer, it would also be passed in here.CopyAsk AIgraph = builder.compile()\\nLangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let’s inspect our sequence. See this guide for detail on visualization.CopyAsk AIfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\n\\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\nLet’s proceed with a simple invocation:CopyAsk AIgraph.invoke({\"value_1\": \"c\"})\\nCopyAsk AI{\\'value_1\\': \\'a b\\', \\'value_2\\': 10}\\nNote that:\\nWe kicked off invocation by providing a value for a single state key. We must always provide a value for at least one key.\\nThe value we passed in was overwritten by the first node.\\nThe second node updated the value.\\nThe third node populated a different value.\\nBuilt-in shorthand\\nlanggraph>=0.2.46 includes a built-in short-hand add_sequence for adding node sequences. You can compile the same graph as follows:CopyAsk AIbuilder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])  \\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\ngraph.invoke({\"value_1\": \"c\"})\\n\\n\\u200bCreate branches\\nParallel execution of nodes is essential to speed up overall graph operation. LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and conditional_edges. Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you.\\n\\u200bRun graph nodes in parallel\\nIn this example, we fan out from Node A to B and C and then fan in to D. With our state, we specify the reducer add operation. This will combine or accumulate values for the specific key in the State, rather than simply overwriting the existing value. For lists, this means concatenating the new list with the existing list. See the above section on state reducers for more detail on updating state with reducers.\\nCopyAsk AIimport operator\\nfrom typing import Annotated, Any\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only\\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\\n\\ndef a(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"A\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"A\"]}\\n\\ndef b(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"B\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B\"]}\\n\\ndef c(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"C\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"C\"]}\\n\\ndef d(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"D\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"D\"]}\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_node(a)\\nbuilder.add_node(b)\\nbuilder.add_node(c)\\nbuilder.add_node(d)\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"b\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"c\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"d\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"c\", \"d\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"d\", END)\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nCopyAsk AIfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\n\\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\n\\nWith the reducer, you can see that the values added in each node are accumulated.\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []}, {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"foo\"}})\\n\\nCopyAsk AIAdding \"A\" to []\\nAdding \"B\" to [\\'A\\']\\nAdding \"C\" to [\\'A\\']\\nAdding \"D\" to [\\'A\\', \\'B\\', \\'C\\']\\n\\nIn the above example, nodes \"b\" and \"c\" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. Because they are in the same step, node \"d\" executes after both \"b\" and \"c\" are finished.Importantly, updates from a parallel superstep may not be ordered consistently. If you need a consistent, predetermined ordering of updates from a parallel superstep, you should write the outputs to a separate field in the state together with a value with which to order them.\\nException handling?LangGraph executes nodes within supersteps, meaning that while parallel branches are executed in parallel, the entire superstep is transactional. If any of these branches raises an exception, none of the updates are applied to the state (the entire superstep errors).Importantly, when using a checkpointer, results from successful nodes within a superstep are saved, and don’t repeat when resumed.If you have error-prone (perhaps want to handle flakey API calls), LangGraph provides two ways to address this:\\nYou can write regular python code within your node to catch and handle exceptions.\\nYou can set a retry_policy to direct the graph to retry nodes that raise certain types of exceptions. Only failing branches are retried, so you needn’t worry about performing redundant work.\\nTogether, these let you perform parallel execution and fully control exception handling.\\nSet max concurrency\\nYou can control the maximum number of concurrent tasks by setting max_concurrency in the configuration when invoking the graph.CopyAsk AIgraph.invoke({\"value_1\": \"c\"}, {\"configurable\": {\"max_concurrency\": 10}})\\n\\n\\u200bDefer node execution\\nDeferring node execution is useful when you want to delay the execution of a node until all other pending tasks are completed. This is particularly relevant when branches have different lengths, which is common in workflows like map-reduce flows.\\nThe above example showed how to fan-out and fan-in when each path was only one step. But what if one branch had more than one step? Let’s add a node \"b_2\" in the \"b\" branch:\\nCopyAsk AIimport operator\\nfrom typing import Annotated, Any\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only\\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\\n\\ndef a(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"A\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"A\"]}\\n\\ndef b(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"B\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B\"]}\\n\\ndef b_2(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"B_2\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"B_2\"]}\\n\\ndef c(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"C\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"C\"]}\\n\\ndef d(state: State):\\n    print(f\\'Adding \"D\" to {state[\"aggregate\"]}\\')\\n    return {\"aggregate\": [\"D\"]}\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_node(a)\\nbuilder.add_node(b)\\nbuilder.add_node(b_2)\\nbuilder.add_node(c)\\nbuilder.add_node(d, defer=True)  \\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"b\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"a\", \"c\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"b_2\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b_2\", \"d\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"c\", \"d\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"d\", END)\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nCopyAsk AIfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\n\\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\n\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.invoke({\"aggregate\": []})\\n\\nCopyAsk AIAdding \"A\" to []\\nAdding \"B\" to [\\'A\\']\\nAdding \"C\" to [\\'A\\']\\nAdding \"B_2\" to [\\'A\\', \\'B\\', \\'C\\']\\nAdding \"D\" to [\\'A\\', \\'B\\', \\'C\\', \\'B_2\\']\\n\\nIn the above example, nodes \"b\" and \"c\" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. We set defer=True on node d so it will not execute until all pending tasks are finished. In this case, this means that \"d\" waits to execute until the entire \"b\" branch is finished.\\n\\u200bConditional branching\\nIf your fan-out should vary at runtime based on the state, you can use add_conditional_edges to select one or more paths using the graph state. See example below, where node a generates a state update that determines the following node.\\nCopyAsk AIimport operator\\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, Sequence\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]\\n    # Add a key to the state.

This is most commonly done by adding a conditional edge that routes to the END node once we reach some termination condition.\\nYou can also set the graph recursion limit when invoking or streaming the graph. The recursion limit sets the number of supersteps that the graph is allowed to execute before it raises an error. Read more about the concept of recursion limits here.\\nLet’s consider a simple graph with a loop to better understand how these mechanisms work.\\nTo return the last value of your state instead of receiving a recursion limit error, see the next section.\\nWhen creating a loop, you can include a conditional edge that specifies a termination condition:\\nCopyAsk AIbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_node(a)\\nbuilder.add_node(b)\\n\\ndef route(state: State) -> Literal[\"b\", END]:\\n    if termination_condition(state):\\n        return END\\n    else:\\n        return \"b\"\\n\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"a\")\\nbuilder.add_conditional_edges(\"a\", route)\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"b\", \"a\")\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nTo control the recursion limit, specify \"recursionLimit\" in the config.

To demonstrate async invocations of underlying LLMs, we will include a chat model:\\n OpenAI Anthropic Azure Google Gemini AWS Bedrock👉 Read the OpenAI chat model integration docsCopyAsk AIpip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyAsk AIimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\")\\n\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph\\n\\nasync def node(state: MessagesState):  \\n    new_message = await llm.ainvoke(state[\"messages\"])  \\n    return {\"messages\": [new_message]}\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState).add_node(node).set_entry_point(\"node\")\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\ninput_message = {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}\\nresult = await graph.ainvoke({\"messages\": [input_message]})  \\n\\nAsync streaming\\nSee the streaming guide for examples of streaming with async.\\n\\u200bCombine control flow and state updates with Command\\nIt can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:\\nCopyAsk AIdef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\\n    return Command(\\n        # state update\\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\\n        # control flow\\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\\n    )\\n\\nWe show an end-to-end example below. Let’s create a simple graph with 3 nodes: A, B and C. We will first execute node A, and then decide whether to go to Node B or Node C next based on the output of node A.\\nCopyAsk AIimport random\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict, Literal\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START\\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\\n\\n# Define graph state\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    foo: str\\n\\n# Define the nodes\\n\\ndef node_a(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"]]:\\n    print(\"Called A\")\\n    value = random.choice([\"b\", \"c\"])\\n    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function\\n    if value == \"b\":\\n        goto = \"node_b\"\\n    else:\\n        goto = \"node_c\"\\n\\n    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node\\n    return Command(\\n        # this is the state update\\n        update={\"foo\": value},\\n        # this is a replacement for an edge\\n        goto=goto,\\n    )\\n\\ndef node_b(state: State):\\n    print(\"Called B\")\\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"foo\"] + \"b\"}\\n\\ndef node_c(state: State):\\n    print(\"Called C\")\\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"foo\"] + \"c\"}\\n\\nWe can now create the StateGraph with the above nodes. Notice that the graph doesn’t have conditional edges for routing! This is because control flow is defined with Command inside node_a.\\nCopyAsk AIbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\\nbuilder.add_node(node_a)\\nbuilder.add_node(node_b)\\nbuilder.add_node(node_c)\\n# NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nYou might have noticed that we used Command as a return type annotation, e.g. Command[Literal[\"node_b\", \"node_c\"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that node_a can navigate to node_b and node_c.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom IPython.display import display, Image\\n\\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\n\\nIf we run the graph multiple times, we’d see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.invoke({\"foo\": \"\"})\\n\\nCopyAsk AICalled A\\nCalled C\\n\\n\\u200bNavigate to a node in a parent graph\\nIf you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:\\nCopyAsk AIdef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\\n    return Command(\\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\\n        goto=\"other_subgraph\",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph\\n        graph=Command.PARENT\\n    )\\n\\nLet’s demonstrate this using the above example. We’ll do so by changing nodeA in the above example into a single-node graph that we’ll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.\\nState updates with Command.PARENT\\nWhen you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that’s shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you’re updating in the parent graph state. See the example below.\\nCopyAsk AIimport operator\\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # NOTE: we define a reducer here\\n    foo: Annotated[str, operator.add]  \\n\\ndef node_a(state: State):\\n    print(\"Called A\")\\n    value = random.choice([\"a\", \"b\"])\\n    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function\\n    if value == \"a\":\\n        goto = \"node_b\"\\n    else:\\n        goto = \"node_c\"\\n\\n    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node\\n    return Command(\\n        update={\"foo\": value},\\n        goto=goto,\\n        # this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph\\n        # NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph\\n        graph=Command.PARENT,  \\n    )\\n\\nsubgraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node_a).add_edge(START, \"node_a\").compile()\\n\\ndef node_b(state: State):\\n    print(\"Called B\")\\n    # NOTE: since we\\'ve defined a reducer, we don\\'t need to manually append\\n    # new characters to existing \\'foo\\' value. instead, reducer will append these\\n    # automatically (via operator.add)\\n    return {\"foo\": \"b\"}  \\n\\ndef node_c(state: State):\\n    print(\"Called C\")\\n    return {\"foo\": \"c\"}  \\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"subgraph\")\\nbuilder.add_node(\"subgraph\", subgraph)\\nbuilder.add_node(node_b)\\nbuilder.add_node(node_c)\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\n\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.invoke({\"foo\": \"\"})\\n\\nCopyAsk AICalled A\\nCalled C\\n\\n\\u200bUse inside tools\\nA common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return Command(update={\"my_custom_key\": \"foo\", \"messages\": [...]}) from the tool:\\nCopyAsk AI@tool\\ndef lookup_user_info(tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):\\n    \"\"\"Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions.\"\"\"\\n    user_info = get_user_info(config.get(\"configurable\", {}).get(\"user_id\"))\\n    return Command(\\n        update={\\n            # update the state keys\\n            \"user_info\": user_info,\\n            # update the message history\\n            \"messages\": [ToolMessage(\"Successfully looked up user information\", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]\\n        }\\n    )\\n\\nYou MUST include messages (or any state key used for the message history) in Command.update when returning Command from a tool and the list of messages in messages MUST contain a ToolMessage. This is necessary for the resulting message history to be valid (LLM providers require AI messages with tool calls to be followed by the tool result messages).\\nIf you are using tools that update state via Command, we recommend using prebuilt ToolNode which automatically handles tools returning Command objects and propagates them to the graph state. If you’re writing a custom node that calls tools, you would need to manually propagate Command objects returned by the tools as the update from the node.\\n\\u200bVisualize your graph\\nHere we demonstrate how to visualize the graphs you create.\\nYou can visualize any arbitrary Graph, including StateGraph.\\nLet’s have some fun by drawing fractals :).\\nCopyAsk AIimport random\\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\nclass MyNode:\\n    def __init__(self, name: str):\\n        self.name = name\\n    def __call__(self, state: State):\\n        return {\"messages\": [(\"assistant\", f\"Called node {self.name}\")]}\\n\\ndef route(state) -> Literal[\"entry_node\", END]:\\n    if len(state[\"messages\"]) > 10:\\n        return END\\n    return \"entry_node\"\\n\\ndef add_fractal_nodes(builder, current_node, level, max_level):\\n    if level > max_level:\\n        return\\n    # Number of nodes to create at this level\\n    num_nodes = random.randint(1, 3)  # Adjust randomness as needed\\n    for i in range(num_nodes):\\n        nm = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"][i]\\n        node_name = f\"node_{current_node}_{nm}\"\\n        builder.add_node(node_name, MyNode(node_name))\\n        builder.add_edge(current_node, node_name)\\n        # Recursively add more nodes\\n        r = random.random()\\n        if r > 0.2 and level + 1 < max_level:\\n            add_fractal_nodes(builder, node_name, level + 1, max_level)\\n        elif r > 0.05:\\n            builder.add_conditional_edges(node_name, route, node_name)\\n        else:\\n            # End\\n            builder.add_edge(node_name, END)\\n\\ndef build_fractal_graph(max_level: int):\\n    builder = StateGraph(State)\\n    entry_point = \"entry_node\"\\n    builder.add_node(entry_point, MyNode(entry_point))\\n    builder.add_edge(START, entry_point)\\n    add_fractal_nodes(builder, entry_point, 1, max_level)\\n    # Optional: set a finish point if required\\n    builder.add_edge(entry_point, END)  # or any specific node\\n    return builder.compile()\\n\\napp = build_fractal_graph(3)\\n\\n\\u200bMermaid\\nWe can also convert a graph class into Mermaid syntax.\\nCopyAsk AIprint(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid())\\n\\nCopyAsk AI%%{init: {\\'flowchart\\': {\\'curve\\': \\'linear\\'}}}%%\\ngraph TD;\\n    tart__([<p>__start__</p>]):::first\\n    ry_node(entry_node)\\n    e_entry_node_A(node_entry_node_A)\\n    e_entry_node_B(node_entry_node_B)\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_A(node_node_entry_node_B_A)\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_B(node_node_entry_node_B_B)\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_C(node_node_entry_node_B_C)\\n    nd__([<p>__end__</p>]):::last\\n    tart__ --> entry_node;\\n    ry_node --> __end__;\\n    ry_node --> node_entry_node_A;\\n    ry_node --> node_entry_node_B;\\n    e_entry_node_B --> node_node_entry_node_B_A;\\n    e_entry_node_B --> node_node_entry_node_B_B;\\n    e_entry_node_B --> node_node_entry_node_B_C;\\n    e_entry_node_A -.-> entry_node;\\n    e_entry_node_A -.-> __end__;\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_A -.-> entry_node;\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_A -.-> __end__;\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_B -.-> entry_node;\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_B -.-> __end__;\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_C -.-> entry_node;\\n    e_node_entry_node_B_C -.-> __end__;\\n    ssDef default fill:#f2f0ff,line-height:1.2\\n    ssDef first fill-opacity:0\\n    ssDef last fill:#bfb6fc\\n\\n\\u200bPNG\\nIf preferred, we could render the Graph into a .png.

Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with models and tools.\\nWe will commonly use LangChain components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s agents that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.\\nLangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.\\n\\u200b Install\\npipuvCopyAsk AIpip install -U langgraph\\n\\nThen, create a simple hello world example:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\\n\\ndef mock_llm(state: MessagesState):\\n    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"ai\", \"content\": \"hello world\"}]}\\n\\ngraph = StateGraph(MessagesState)\\ngraph.add_node(mock_llm)\\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"mock_llm\")\\ngraph.add_edge(\"mock_llm\", END)\\ngraph = graph.compile()\\n\\ngraph.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi!\"}]})\\n\\n\\u200bCore benefits\\nLangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for any long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\\n\\nDurable execution: Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\\nHuman-in-the-loop: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.\\nComprehensive memory: Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\\nDebugging with LangSmith: Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.\\nProduction-ready deployment: Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.\\n\\n\\u200bLangGraph ecosystem\\nWhile LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:\\n\\nLangSmith — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.\\nLangSmith — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in Studio.\\nLangChain - Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.\\n\\n\\u200bAcknowledgements\\nLangGraph is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam. The public interface draws inspiration from NetworkX. LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.\\n\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\nConnect these docs programmatically to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for    real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoWhat\\'s new in v1Next⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Install the LangGraph CLI\\npipuvCopyAsk AI# Python >= 3.11 is required.\\npip install -U \"langgraph-cli[inmem]\"\\n\\n\\u200b2. Create a LangGraph app 🌱\\nCreate a new app from the new-langgraph-project-python template. This template demonstrates a single-node application you can extend with your own logic.\\nCopyAsk AIlanggraph new path/to/your/app --template new-langgraph-project-python\\n\\nAdditional templates\\nIf you use langgraph new without specifying a template, you will be presented with an interactive menu that will allow you to choose from a list of available templates.\\n\\u200b3. Install dependencies\\nIn the root of your new LangGraph app, install the dependencies in edit mode so your local changes are used by the server:\\npipuvCopyAsk AIcd path/to/your/app\\npip install -e .\\n\\n\\u200b4. Create a .env file\\nYou will find a .env.example in the root of your new LangGraph app. Create a .env file in the root of your new LangGraph app and copy the contents of the .env.example file into it, filling in the necessary API keys:\\nCopyAsk AILANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2...\\n\\n\\u200b5. Launch Agent server 🚀\\nStart the LangGraph API server locally:\\nCopyAsk AIlanggraph dev\\n\\nSample output:\\nCopyAsk AI>    Ready!\\n>\\n>    - API: [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024/)\\n>\\n>    - Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs\\n>\\n>    - LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024\\n\\nThe langgraph dev command starts Agent Server in an in-memory mode. This mode is suitable for development and testing purposes. For production use, deploy Agent Server with access to a persistent storage backend. For more information, see the Platform setup overview.\\n\\u200b6. Test your application in Studio\\nStudio is a specialized UI that you can connect to LangGraph API server to visualize, interact with, and debug your application locally. Test your graph in Studio by visiting the URL provided in the output of the langgraph dev command:\\nCopyAsk AI>    - LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024\\n\\nFor an Agent Server running on a custom host/port, update the baseURL parameter.\\nSafari compatibilityUse the --tunnel flag with your command to create a secure tunnel, as Safari has limitations when connecting to localhost servers:CopyAsk AIlanggraph dev --tunnel\\n\\n\\u200b7. Test the API\\n Python SDK (async) Python SDK (sync) Rest API\\nInstall the LangGraph Python SDK:\\nCopyAsk AIpip install langgraph-sdk\\n\\nSend a message to the assistant (threadless run):\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph_sdk import get_client\\nimport asyncio\\n\\nclient = get_client(url=\"http://localhost:2024\")\\n\\nasync def main():\\n    async for chunk in client.runs.stream(\\n        None,  # Threadless run\\n        \"agent\", # Name of assistant.
