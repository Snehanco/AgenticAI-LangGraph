       "\"Published: 2021-05-07\\nTitle: Do You Even Need Attention? A Stack of Feed-Forward Layers Does Surprisingly Well on ImageNet\\nAuthors: Luke Melas-Kyriazi\\nSummary: The strong performance of vision transformers on image classification and other vision tasks is often attributed to the design of their multi-head attention layers. However, the extent to which attention is responsible for this strong performance remains unclear. In this short report, we ask: is the attention layer even necessary? Specifically, we replace the attention layer in a vision transformer with a feed-forward layer applied over the patch dimension. The resulting architecture is simply a series of feed-forward layers applied over the patch and feature dimensions in an alternating fashion. In experiments on ImageNet, this architecture performs surprisingly well: a ViT/DeiT-base-sized model obtains 74.9\\\\% top-1 accuracy, compared to 77.9\\\\% and 79.9\\\\% for ViT and DeiT respectively. These results indicate that aspects of vision transformers other than attention, such as the patch embedding, may be more responsible for their strong performance than previously thought. We hope these results prompt the community to spend more time trying to understand why our current models are as effective as they are.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-07-02\\nTitle: Quit When You Can: Efficient Evaluation of Ensembles with Ordering Optimization\\nAuthors: Serena Wang, Maya Gupta, Seungil You\\nSummary: Given a classifier ensemble and a set of examples to be classified, many examples may be confidently and accurately classified after only a subset of the base models in the ensemble are evaluated. This can reduce both mean latency and CPU while maintaining the high accuracy of the original ensemble. To achieve such gains, we propose jointly optimizing a fixed evaluation order of the base models and early-stopping thresholds. Our proposed objective is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we provide a greedy algorithm that achieves a 4-approximation of the optimal solution for certain cases. For those cases, this is also the best achievable polynomial time approximation bound unless $P = NP$. Experiments on benchmark and real-world problems show that the proposed Quit When You Can (QWYC) algorithm can speed-up average evaluation time by $2$x--$4$x, and is around $1.5$x faster than prior work. QWYC's joint optimization of ordering and thresholds also performed better in experiments than various fixed orderings, including gradient boosted trees' ordering.\""

      "Summary: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n"

      "**Machine learning (ML)** is a field of computer science that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Idea\n",
      "- **Learning from data**: Instead of being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario, an ML model is trained on a dataset. During training, it adjusts internal parameters (weights) to capture relationships in the data.\n",
      "- **Generalization**: After training, the model is expected to perform well on new, unseen data that comes from the same underlying distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components\n",
      "| Component | What it Does |\n",
      "|-----------|--------------|\n",
      "| **Data** | The raw input (images, text, numbers, etc.) used for training. |\n",
      "| **Model** | A mathematical representation (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, neural network) that maps inputs to outputs. |\n",
      "| **Algorithm** | The procedure that updates the model’s parameters based on the data (e.g., gradient descent). |\n",
      "| **Loss function** | A measure of how far the model’s predictions are from the true values; the algorithm tries to minimize this. |\n",
      "| **Evaluation** | Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) used to assess how well the model works on unseen data. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of Machine Learning\n",
      "| Type | Typical Tasks | Example Algorithms |\n",
      "|------|---------------|--------------------|\n",
      "| **Supervised Learning** | Predict a label or value given input data. | Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, neural networks. |\n",
      "| **Unsupervised Learning** | Discover hidden structure in unlabeled data. | K‑means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders. |\n",
      "| **Semi‑Supervised Learning** | Combine a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. | Semi‑supervised SVM, graph‑based methods. |\n",
      "| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learn to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. | Q‑learning, policy gradients, Deep Q‑Networks (DQNs). |\n",
      "| **Self‑Supervised / Contrastive Learning** | Generate supervisory signals from the data itself (e.g., predicting missing parts). | SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### Typical Workflow\n",
      "1. **Problem definition**: Identify the goal (classification, regression, recommendation, etc.).  \n",
      "2. **Data collection & preprocessing**: Gather data, clean it, normalize, handle missing values, split into train/validation/test sets.  \n",
      "3. **Model selection**: Choose an algorithm that fits the problem and data size.  \n",
      "4. **Training**: Feed data to the model, update parameters to minimize loss.  \n",
      "5. **Validation & hyper‑parameter tuning**: Adjust learning rate, regularization, architecture depth, etc.  \n",
      "6. **Testing**: Evaluate on a held‑out test set to estimate real‑world performance.  \n",
      "7. **Deployment & monitoring**: Integrate the model into production and monitor for drift or degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Real‑World Applications\n",
      "- **Image & speech recognition** (e.g., facial recognition, voice assistants).  \n",
      "- **Natural language processing** (e.g., translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots).  \n",
      "- **Recommendation systems** (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).  \n",
